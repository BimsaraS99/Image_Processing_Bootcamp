# Read, Display, and Save Images Using OpenCV

### Task Overview:
In this task, we'll use OpenCV to:
1. **Read** the image file (`vk.jpg`) using the `imread()` function.
2. **Display** the image using the `imshow()` function.
3. **Save** the image with a new name, `output_image.jpg`, in the same folder where the original `vk.jpg` file is located.
