## Detecting an Edge and Finding its Line Equation without Hough Transform

### Introduction
Edge detection is a fundamental operation in image processing, often used to identify boundaries within an image. In this article, we’ll demonstrate a step-by-step approach to detect an edge in an image and compute its line equation \( y = mx + c \) using a straightforward linear regression method, bypassing the need for the Hough Transform.

### Objective
The goal is to detect a prominent edge in an image and calculate the equation of the line representing this edge. This process is particularly useful in scenarios where Hough Transform may not be ideal due to computational constraints or specific requirements.

### Steps to Accomplish the Task

#### 1. Load the Image
Begin by loading the image into your program using an image processing library such as OpenCV or PIL. Ensure the image is in grayscale for simplified processing.

#### 2. Detect Edges
Apply an edge-detection algorithm to identify edges in the image. Common techniques include:
   - **Sobel Operator**: Detects gradient changes in intensity.
   - **Canny Edge Detection**: A multi-stage algorithm for precise edge detection.

#### 3. Isolate the Target Edge
Post-process the detected edges to isolate the edge of interest:
   - Use thresholding to filter out weaker edges.
   - Apply morphological operations like dilation and erosion to clean up the edge map.

#### 4. Extract Edge Points
Find the pixel coordinates of the detected edge. This can be achieved by iterating through the binary edge map and collecting non-zero pixel locations.

#### 5. Perform Linear Regression
Using the extracted points, fit a straight line to determine its slope (\( m \)) and y-intercept (\( c \)). The steps include:
   - Compute the mean of the x and y coordinates.
   - Calculate the slope (\( m \)) using the formula:
     \[
     m = \frac{\sum{(x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})}}{\sum{(x_i - \bar{x})^2}}
     \]
   - Calculate the y-intercept (\( c \)) using:
     \[
     c = \bar{y} - m\bar{x}
     \]

#### 6. Display Results
Overlay the detected line on the original image and display its equation \( y = mx + c \). This visualization helps confirm the accuracy of the detection process.


### Benefits of This Method
- Avoids computational overhead associated with the Hough Transform.
- Provides direct computation of the line equation using basic linear regression.
- Suitable for tasks requiring simpler or custom approaches to edge detection.

### Applications
This method is ideal for:
- Robotics: Determining edges in real-time for navigation.
- Quality Control: Identifying straight-line defects in manufacturing.
- Vision Systems: Detecting boundaries in images for further processing.

### Conclusion
Detecting an edge and computing its equation without the Hough Transform is a straightforward yet effective approach in many scenarios. By following the outlined steps, you can easily achieve this using basic image processing and linear regression techniques.
