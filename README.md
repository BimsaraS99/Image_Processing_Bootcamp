## Introduction
This course covers the fundamental and advanced topics in image processing and computer vision. Through practical tasks, you will learn how to manipulate images, detect features, segment objects, and apply machine learning models to real-world problems.

## Course Structure
The course is divided into several key sections, each consisting of hands-on tasks:

1. **Introduction to Image Processing**: Basics of images, libraries, and formats.
2. **Image Manipulation**: Resizing, cropping, rotating, and geometric transformations.
3. **Color Spaces**: Understanding and using different color models.
4. **Filters and Convolution**: Applying filters like Gaussian blur and edge detection.
5. **Morphological Operations**: Advanced operations for binary images.
6. **Segmentation**: Techniques like thresholding and watershed.
7. **Feature Detection**: Detecting and matching key points.
8. **Frequency Domain Analysis**: Fourier transforms and filtering.
9. **Machine Learning**: Image classification and object detection.
10. **Real-Time Processing**: Processing video streams in real-time.
11. **Advanced Topics**: Image stitching, optical flow, and more.
12. **Optimization & Deployment**: Real-time optimization and deployment on embedded devices.
