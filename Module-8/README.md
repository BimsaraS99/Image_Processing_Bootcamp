### Task: Contour Detection and Centroid Calculation

You are given an image containing multiple letters.

Your objective is to:

1. Detect the contours of each letter in the image.
2. Calculate the centroid (center of mass) of each detected contour.
3. Mark the detected centroids on the image.
4. Output the processed image with centroids clearly indicated.

Output image:

The centroids should be represented using a visual marker (such as a red dot or a cross) on each letter. The final image should clearly show all contours and their corresponding centroids.
